## 4. How to Remaster Smartphone Concert Footage in Topaz Video AI (The RJMedia Blueprint)

Filming on a phone at the front barrier creates four specific challenges: **Variable Frame Rate (VFR)**, **Phone ISP over-sharpening halos**, **Subwoofer OIS lens shake**, and **Blue/Magenta LED sensor clipping**. Here is the exact profile used to master phone concert footage without turning faces into plastic:

```json
{{
  "Preset": "RJMedia_Smartphone_Concert_4K",
  "Model": "Proteus v4 (prob-4)",
  "Scale": "2x (1080p Phone -> 4K UHD)",
  "Revert Compression": 42,
  "Improve Detail": 28,
  "Sharpen": 15,
  "Reduce Noise": 22,
  "Dehalo": 35,
  "Anti-Alias / Deblur": 12,
  "Recover Original Detail": 60,
  "Add Noise": 2
}}
